##What are Netual networks

### Biological Netual Networks

Netual networks are a computers way to encode real world infomation into a way for a computer to understand.
The objective of Netual networks is to allow computers to solve problems real world problems such as, driving
and object dections. Similar to nerons, Netual networks work on the anollogy of the brain. The brain processes
infomation by encoding it into electrity. Which is the lanagage that nerons speak. The network of nerons that process that infomation to make descions. Over the span of a long time these networks have evolved into the brains we see today. The networks that processed the infomation in different ways and become effective at making decsions that we
see as simple. Even a simple decsion can consist of millions of calculations that the brain does on a consisent bases.

### Computer Netual networks

Machine Netual Networks work on the same type of infomation encoding and processing like the brain. But theres a key differents, Computers arent biological. Meaning they cannot encode infomation into chemical signals. Instead infomation in Machine Netual Networks are encoded into mathametical formulas. These formulas dectate the abilities of the netual net to process and effectivaly work with the infomation give.
